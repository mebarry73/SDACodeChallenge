# Invoice Scanner Service

This is a service that checks given PDF files for blacklisted IBANs.

I used Spring Boot, H2 and Apache PDFBox.

# Installation / Building

We need git and maven either on Windows or Linux installed already.

Call 'git clone https://github.com/mebarry73/SDACodeChallenge.git' to checkout the project.
Get all dependencies and build the project with 'mvn clean install' (from inside the checked out project).

# Running 

Call 'mvn spring-boot:run' (from inside the checked out project) to start the application from command line.
